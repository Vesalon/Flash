Lightweight event app
Not tied to social network app
Initial target users: young/college students. Perfect for pickup games
Distribution lists – example: “my Frisbee group”
Karma system – show # of events attended, # of events organized
Open local events – based on location. (People can host for free, but if a company wants to host a promotional one, they must pay (payment is per person rsvp’d))
-Partner with yelp for promotional events(?)
The REAL social app - market app specifically as something that assists you doing something in the real world, not like facebook, Instagram, twitter that reinforces you to stay in front of a computer. Geared to make you go out and participate.
Add contacts from email, facebook, etc.

Use kickstarter to fund some initial costs(?)

ability to have repeat events, for example send out invites every wednesday for frisbee game on fridays.

MOST IMPORTANT - streamline adding new event

if someone rsvp’s as going, but does not show up, host is allowed to “mark” this person within context of distribution list. For example, friend misses Frisbee game, next time you send invite to “my Frisbee group” you get a notification that you marked this friend

accepting two events that overlap - remind user

Add registry/checklist function for things like potlucks

open event - choose radius (have default)
  - have ability to follow (even outside of radius)
  -search open events by location by gps and by address
  -pin open event (instead of accepting, similar to "remind me later")
  -ability to invite friends to open event, and make as though it is a private "sub-event"


Research meetup/eventrbrite/facebook events
Meetup-possibly geared to older crowd
Eventbrite-buy tickets, register, etc. – too much
Facebook-not effective
All feel too heavyweight

Text message interact with app, so that rsvping doesn’t require app. Similar to groupme, where if you don’t have app, you still get message and can respond

catching ride functionality
  -uber integration?

group chat - geared toward discussing event/getting information
  -should be able to also talk private within event page (two people attending talking)



Problems:
Hosting cost
Big competitors


Development tools (for now):
Nosql/mysql
Python (something similar to Microsoft mvc) (django)
Hybrid mobile web app
